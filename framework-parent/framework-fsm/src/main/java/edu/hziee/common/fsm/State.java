/**
 * A state describes a behavioral node of the system in which it is waiting for
 * a trigger to execute a transition. The same stimulus triggers different
 * actions depending on the current state.
 * 
 * I prefer to use singletons for the states,Using singletons makes the design
 * more efficient because they remove the need to allocate and deallocate memory
 * every time a state change is made. Because they are shared between clients,
 * singleton states are unable to make use of their own local data, but if you
 * find that the states you have designed are repeatedly accessing lots of
 * external data, itâ€™s probably worth considering disposing of the singleton
 * design and writing a few lines of code to manage the allocation and
 * deallocation of state memory.
